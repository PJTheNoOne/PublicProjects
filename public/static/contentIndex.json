I’m a resourceful engineer with diverse skills in both mechanical and computer engineering. Thanks to my major in Engineering Physics and a minor in Computer Science, I’ve been able to delve into multiple aspects of engineering. I have hands-on experience building and using Voron 3D printers, developing real-time embedded systems, and creating walking machines and coil guns.\nBut I’m not just a techie; I also love leading and sharing knowledge. As the former President of the Pioneer Drone Club at UW-Platteville, I was responsible for club operations, maintaining an extensive set of drone equipment, and organizing educational tutorials on FPV drone piloting.\nWhether it’s assembling a state-of-the-art 3D printer, coding an efficient algorithm, or leading a motivated team, I’m always up for a new challenge!\nResumes §"},"AboutMe/Resumes":{"title":"Resumes","links":[],"tags":["resume"],"content":"Mechanical Focused Resume §\n\n                      \n                    \nComputer Sci/Software Engineering Resume §\n\n                      \n                    "}}
