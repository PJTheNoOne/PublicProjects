## An Quick Explanation of FPV Drones.
An FPV (First Person View) drone consists of several key components including the carbon fiber frame provides the structure. Motors and propellers generate thrust and are driven by the electronic speed controllers (ESCs) to regulate motor speed. The flight controller is the drone's "brain," processing inputs from the transmitter and sensors to control flight. A lipo battery, not show in the photo, and powers the entire drone. The FPV camera captures a live video feed, transmitting it through a video transmitter (VTX) to FPV goggles or a screen, enabling the pilot to see from the drone's perspective. The radio receiver communicates with the pilot's transmitter, allowing remote control of the drone.

## Experience
Over the past six years, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in every aspect of FPV drones researching, building, troubleshooting, and inevitably crashing, only to repair and improve them. Each step, from selecting parts to troubleshooting hardware and software, has been a hands-on lesson. Leading the Pioneer Drone Club as its president gave me the chance to share this passion, foster teamwork, and guide others in exploring FPV technology. These experiences have shaped both my technical expertise and leadership skills, providing a foundation that continues to drive my enthusiasm for drone innovation.
