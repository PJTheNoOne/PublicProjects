## Additive Manufacturing

I’ve spent the past 8 years working with 3D printing, starting with a Sidewinder X1 and eventually moving on and building a Voron 2.4, which I’ve added seveal mods, including a [[NozeWipe |nozzle wipe]] I designed myself. This progression has honed my skills in design-for-manufacturing and given me practical, in-depth experience in additive manufacturing. Each project has deepened my understanding of 3D printing mechanics, materials, and optimization techniques essential for precise and reliable output.
