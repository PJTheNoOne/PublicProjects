# About
The Scribble~Starter is a pen that lights up and plays sound when writing or drawing on a planner surface. The motivation is to make a tool for promoting writing skills in young kids with or without developmental delays. The work on this project was done in collaboration with Lindsey Rowley at UnityPoint Health.

# Work done
Sydney Bruce, Madalyn Kaweski, Cameron Uselding, and I completed this project as part of Engineering Physics Senior Design. Lindsey and Dr. Evensen provided several topics and project ideas for our project. We took the suggested topics and created the Scribble~Starter project. We defined the project definition and constraints, proposed and reviewed alternate designs, and completed a risk analysis. We also completed project planning steps, such as project decomposition, and planned with a Gantt Chart. We also started the process of patenting this project through [WiSys](https://www.wisys.org/). Finally, we finished designing it and testing the prototype. 

I initially helped with the machine learning model and some embedded system knowledge. Next, I helped with comparing alternative designs and project risk analysis. I mostly did the fabrication using my skills with 3D printing and soldering. I also completed the final CAD model; doing so was vital because I shrunk the prototype to a reasonable size. Most importantly, it allowed for testing with an actual wring utensil.
# Future Improvements

Even though we achieved most of the project's goals, several things can be improved. First is the clamping mechanism used to hold a writing utensil. The design used in the final prototype used three TPU parts that would clamp when compressed. The TPU sections did clamp the writing utensil; however, the mechanism to compress the TPU needs work. Another potential fix is not to compress the TPU; instead, make a long and more flexible arch. Doing so would remove moving parts and simplify assembly. 

We did not make this change because we ran out of time. The project needed to be completed in a semester. Luckily, there are plans to finish more work on this project as another senior design project.
