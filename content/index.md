# About Me
Hello there! I'm a resourceful engineer with diverse mechanical and computer engineering skills. Thanks to my Engineering Physics major and Computer Science minor, I've delved into multiple aspects of engineering. I have hands-on experience building and using Voron 3D printers, developing real-time embedded systems, and creating walking machines and coil guns.

But I'm not just a techie; I love learning and sharing knowledge. As the former President of the Pioneer Drone Club at UW-Platteville, I was responsible for club operations, maintaining an extensive set of drone equipment, and organizing educational tutorials on FPV drone piloting.

Whether it's assembling a state-of-the-art 3D printer, coding an efficient algorithm, or leading a motivated team, I'm always up for a new challenge!
