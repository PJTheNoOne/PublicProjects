# About 

Hello there! I'm a resourceful engineer with diverse skills in both mechanical and computer engineering. Thanks to my major in Engineering Physics and a minor in Computer Science, I've been able to delve into multiple aspects of engineering. I have hands-on experience building and using Voron 3D printers, developing real-time embedded systems, and creating walking machines and coil guns.

But I'm not just a techie; I also love leading and sharing knowledge. As the former President of the Pioneer Drone Club at UW-Platteville, I was responsible for club operations, maintaining an extensive set of drone equipment, and organizing educational tutorials on FPV drone piloting.

Whether it's assembling a state-of-the-art 3D printer, coding an efficient algorithm, or leading a motivated team, I'm always up for a new challenge!
