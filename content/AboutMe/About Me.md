Hello! I'm a resourceful engineer with a solid foundation in both mechanical and computer engineering, shaped by my Engineering Physics major and Computer Science minor. My experience spans building and using 3D printers, developing real-time embedded systems, and creating complex projects like walking machines and coil guns. Additionally, I have a year of hands-on experience at MTI Motion focused on designing and creating electric motors for several applications including the aerospace and defense, down-hole, and other industrial motors.

But I'm not just a techie; I love learning and sharing knowledge. As the former President of the Pioneer Drone Club at UW-Platteville, I was responsible for club operations, maintaining an extensive set of drone equipment, and organizing educational tutorials on [[FPV Drones]] piloting.

Whether it's designing parts for manufacture on a state-of-the-art [[Additive Manufacturing|3D-Printer]], coding an efficient algorithm, or leading a motivated team, I'm always up for a new challenge!
